### DETECTING-AND-VALIDATING-TERM-ASSOCIATIONS-IN-TEXT-CORPUS/

The text discusses the significance of identifying characteristic and discriminating terms and their semantic relationships in text processing applications, particularly in term clustering techniques. The traditional statistical co-occurrence analysis approach considers only the immediate neighbors or sentence-level co-occurrence of two terms. However, the article proposes a flexible approach that uses co-occurrence windows of arbitrary sizes to find statistically significant correlations between two or more terms. This method captures more nuanced semantic relationships between terms and can improve the accuracy of text-processing tasks. The goal is to identify relationships between words or phrases that frequently co-occur in a text corpus and determine whether these relationships are statistically significant and meaningful. This information can then be used in various natural language processing tasks, such as text classification, information retrieval, and sentiment analysis, to improve their accuracy and effectiveness.
